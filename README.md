- 👋 Hi, I’m @Basedhippo, probably the only hippo out here shilling NFTs, breeding like it’s my full-time job, and keeping the roid industry alive.
- 👀 I’m interested in **making my hippos so jacked that even gorillas are starting to feel insecure**. My hobbies include giving out steroids like it's Halloween candy and finding new ways to break the laws of NFT genetics.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **how to keep my hippos from exploding** after their 11th juice cycle. If they don't explode, they just might ascend and become *TrenHippos*, and honestly, who wouldn’t want that?
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on **metaverse projects, hippo combat leagues, and ways to convince people that “Breeding Legends” isn’t a pyramid scheme**. Spoiler alert: it absolutely is.
- 📫 How to reach me: **Don’t.** I’m either juicing hippos or trying to explain to animal control why my hippos are bench pressing cars in the neighborhood. I’d say shoot me a DM, but it might get buried under steroid receipts and apologies to the local zoo.
- 😄 Pronouns: **He / Tren**.
- ⚡ Fun fact: One of my hippos got so jacked that it punched a hole in the blockchain. Honestly, we all thought that was pretty based.
